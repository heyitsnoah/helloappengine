An intro to Python/Django/Appengine.

Things to know:
1. GET and POST
2. Basic Python syntax
3. Data and models

Some tips along the way:
1. Try things and see what happens. You can't really break anything here.
2. When in doubt, Google it. There is no more abundant body of knowledge on the web than instructions on how to build the web. Copy and paste is your friend.
